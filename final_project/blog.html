            <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Jordan first  blog post</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">august 9 , 2019 by <a href="index.html">Jordan</a></p>

            <p>This is my blog and i will be telling you about how my experience< at this camp and i am telling you that this will be the most intresting page that you can see from this camp and you will instantly be surpised./p>
            <hr>
            <p>So far at this camp we were welcome at this buliding and feeling like we were here for years and not just weeks. <a href="#">After you here what i have to say this well feel that we will want to come again next year. </a>, when you are here this community is opening and we will just feel opening and given this opportunity this will give us a chance to haave a good carrer in the furtre. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>When we first started to code it was very hard but with the help of kay ,jewle,and kevin and yes even omar helped us . <strong>Holberton girls coding camp was one of the best summer camps i can go to. </strong> Even today showing are work is hard cause we have to make sure that are work is still good enough to show for are family and friends .</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This opportunity will be amzaing if we will be able to have it for next year and even for a longer time so we can even have a bigger chance with coding somehting stronger. <em>When it comes to coding you have to make sure u ask for help beacuse if you dont then it will be like you tried but it may be worng or you wouldnt have a successful business to run if you dont have a person or more to help you.</em> For Ex:I had Nazaria, Jasmine, Krishna those were just some of the people that were able to help me. </p>
            <h2> Heading 1  about camp </h2>
            <p> You may think that since this was just a coding camp but at this camp we did way more then coding we made friendships we made messes and we of course did coding which helped us till this day cause we were able to make this website that you are able to see and hoepfully use.</p>
            <h3>Heading 2 about the camp </h3>
            <p>When it come to learning how to code are process is that we had to do  projects that could help us with making little codes so that we can make bigger codes so tha this code can be correct and intresting to read along as i speak this to you.</p>
            <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
            <p>.carousel-item {
              height: 32rem;
              background-color: bule;.</p>
            <h3>Heading 3 about camp </h3>
            <p>As you can tell this code showed that we had to first make a little code before we have to make a bigger code for thius website to make it for the final day to show how we were able to do this .</p>
            <ul>
              <li>one we went to the website so we can find out what are projects so that we can learn how to start from the being.</li>
              <li>Two after we found are projects we had a time and date when to finish are projects so that we can pass are lesson so that we can move on to the final section.</li>
              <li>Three the final and stroingest bpoint is that we had to make sure that everthing was saved on to the files or all your work will be gone .</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These were the strongest pouints that i needed so that i knew that my codes could work were we will be able to past the lesson. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Now I will tell you the webiste that we used to help us the first one we used was holberton school website .</li>
              <li>The second website we used was github(https://circleci.com/integrations/github/?utm_source=gnb&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=SEM-gnb-Github-Eng-ni&utm_content=SEM-gnb-Github-Eng-ni-Github&gclid=CjwKCAjw7anqBRALEiwAgvGgm1cXZqsDSWG2xUviCGZUrj9-N4cAKUlDkKO3yzMUNl-0HFoNfdUs2xoCBzoQAvD_BwE)which was what we used that help us check are anwser.</li>
              <li>The thrid website we used was atom which was used to make are codes that we are using today . </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now that you know what we used to make and help check are codes we can go to how my experience here even more.</p>

              <p>Even when I was tried i still was able to do my work and figure out how to code and still socailze while making sure I still got my work done. <strong>Then when it came to not talking it was to were i had to make sure that i had to tune out  them out and just had to foucus on my work with no distraction.</strong> Thoes were the brain skills i had to do for myslef.</p>
